# Traffic Management System (TMS): A Data Science Analysis Project

TMS is a traffic management system that maps all the vehicles to the map.
The code uses ImageAI (https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI).

## How to Use

### Preparing the project

1. Clone this repository

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/72ridwan/tms.git
   cd tms
   ```
   
1. [Download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C3YkvLjn0MWFccc8n9feT2mxrJKs4fDB) the YOLOv3 pre-trained weights data to `darknet` folder.

1. Download the CCTV data and the maps [from this drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11upryL7cOCL8uRIXiJTw1mxLaRUjttm3). Extract the ZIP content to `tms` or root folder.

1. Go to `darknet` folder and compile the C source code
   ```
   cd darknet
   make
   ```

### Detecting the vehicles

Due to the time constraint of this project, we will be focusing only to detect
the vehicles in CCTV of Simpang 5 Patung Kuda Selatan at 12:00.
The video is located in `cctv/SIMPANG 4 PATUNG KUDA`.

1. Go to the root folder.

1. Run the `Pre-processing.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.

1. In the Linux environment, run `detect_and_save.py` to begin detection.
   You can pass the argument to resume the detection from certain frame name
   shall the process was terminated in the middle.
   ```
   python3 detect_and_save.py --start "0000006.jpg" --file_type "jpg" \
     --folder_path="../frame/cctv_SIMPANG 4 PATUNG KUDA_patungkuda selatan 1200_x264.mp4"
   ```
   
### Other configurations

- ##### Operating on GPU
  Currently, this setup is made for CPU purposes and has not been tested on GPU using CUDNN.
  We have not implemented it due to environment complexity, especially on Windows.

- ##### Better CPU utilization
  The default setting is setup for normal CPU utilization. To add more CPU utilization,
  you can add multiprocessing technique by going to `Makefile` and change the line
  `OPENMP=0` to `OPENMP=1`.
